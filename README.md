# Overview of the statistical analysis:
Convince investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.
## The purpose of the analysis is well defined. 
The proposal will persuade one of the key stakeholders to join the venture of creating a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. I will use Pandas to create a new report showing the “tripduration” column as a datatype. I will make several visualizations using tableau to:
•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
